**Abstract**  
*In this work we propose a satellite specific Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF) model capable to obtain a threedimensional
semantic representation (neural semantic field)
of the scene. The model derives the output from a set of
multi-date satellite images with corresponding pixel-wise
semantic labels. We demonstrate the robustness of our approach
and its capability to improve noisy input labels. We
enhance the color prediction by utilizing the semantic information
to adress temporal ima  
ge inconsistencies caused by
non-stationary categories such as vehicles. To facilitate further
research in this domain, we present a dataset comprising
manually generated labels for popular multi-view satellite
images.*
